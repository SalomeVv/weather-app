## About the Project
A basic weather app by city, incorporating wikipedia excerpts for the city, with random sugestions.

The original project aimed to suggest cities by picking the weather but it required more complicated work that the timeframe allowed so it has been scrapped for now.

### Features
- Random city on page load
- Current weather
- Forecast every 3 hours 
- Wikipedia excerpt if availlable
- Menu to check 4 days forward
- Searchbar to look a city up
- Keeps track of and displays the 5 most searched cities
- 5 random suggested cities that can be randomized again
